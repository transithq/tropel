//! Real sub-timing measurement via reqwest extension hooks.
//!
//! reqwest 0.13 does not expose connection-phase timings (blocked / DNS /
//! TCP connect / TLS) through its stable API. It does, however, provide two
//! extension hooks that let us measure them:
//!
//! 1. [`ClientBuilder::dns_resolver`](reqwest::ClientBuilder::dns_resolver) —
//!    a custom [`reqwest::dns::Resolve`] implementation that times DNS lookups.
//! 2. [`ClientBuilder::connector_layer`](reqwest::ClientBuilder::connector_layer) —
//!    a generic tower layer that wraps the connector service and times each
//!    connection attempt (DNS + TCP + TLS for a fresh connection).
//!
//! # Phase attribution (per-request slots)
//!
//! Requests are NOT one-per-thread: `http.batch` interleaves many requests on
//! one thread via `join_all`, and `execute()` runs on the shared multi-thread
//! `io_rt`, so a single request future can even migrate threads between polls.
//! A single thread-local slot would be clobbered by concurrent requests — the
//! old design cross-attributed phases between batch entries (one entry
//! reported everyone's `blocked`/`dns`/`connecting`, the rest got zeros).
//!
//! Instead every request gets its OWN slot (`Arc<Mutex<PhaseSlot>>`, created
//! by [`begin_request`]). Attribution happens through a thread-local *current
//! slot* that the [`TimedRequest`] wrapper installs at the start of **each
//! poll** of the request future and restores when the poll returns. The
//! DNS/connector hooks fire *inside* a poll of that request future (reqwest
//! drives them as part of it), so they observe exactly their request's slot —
//! even with N requests interleaved on one thread. As belt-and-braces the
//! hooks additionally capture the slot at `resolve()` / `call()` entry and
//! thread it through their async completions, so a completion that is polled
//! outside the originating poll (e.g. by hyper on another thread) still
//! writes to the correct slot.
//!
//! # Phase semantics
//!
//! - **blocked**: request start → connector `call()` begins (connection-pool
//!   wait / queueing). Zero when a pooled keep-alive connection is reused.
//! - **dns**: real DNS resolution time, from the resolver hook.
//! - **connecting**: connector call duration − DNS. For `http` this is pure
//!   TCP connect time. For `https`, reqwest folds the TLS handshake into the
//!   same connector call, so TLS time is included here — see
//!   [`Timings::tls_handshaking`](crate::Timings::tls_handshaking).
//! - **tls_handshaking** / **sending**: reqwest seals these inside the
//!   connector / request future; they stay zero. A hyper-based custom
//!   connector would be required to split them out of the connector call.
