//! # Built-in extension wiring
//!
//! The built-in input adapters (postman, har, openapi, k6) register
//! themselves via `inventory::submit!`. However, Rust's linker only pulls
//! object code from a dependency crate that is actually *referenced* from
//! the final binary. Since nothing else in `tropel-engine` mentions these
//! adapter types, their registration statics get dead-stripped and the
//! binary reports "no input adapter recognized" / "none registered".
//!
//! The functions below construct each built-in adapter/driver type, forcing
//! the linker to include the crate's object code — and therefore its
//! `inventory::submit!` registration. This mirrors what `tropel build` does
//! when it emits `extern crate {name};` lines into the generated `main.rs`.
//!
//! `register_builtins()` is invoked from the CLI at startup, before the
//! `ExtensionRegistry` performs its `collect_inventory()` pass.
