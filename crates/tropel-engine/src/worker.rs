//! # VUWorkerPool — Thread-per-core VU sharding (1 VU per dedicated thread)
//!
//! Distributes VUs across a pool of current-thread tokio runtimes, each
//! pinned to a dedicated OS thread. This gives each VU core-level isolation:
//!
//! - **No shared work-stealing** — VUs on one core never steal work from another
//! - **Better cache locality** — each core's VU data stays in its L1/L2 cache
//! - **JS execution isolation** — blocking JS on core 0 doesn't stall VUs on core 1
//! - **`sleep()` safety** — each VU owns its OS thread, so a blocking script
//!   `sleep()` (implemented with `std::thread::sleep`) pauses *only* that VU.
//!   The pool grows on demand (`spawn_vu`), so no two VUs ever share a
//!   current-thread runtime — otherwise a `sleep()` in one VU would freeze
//!   every VU co-located on the same worker.
//!
//! # Scalability tradeoff
//!
//! 1 VU per OS thread is the closest Rust analog to k6's goroutine-per-VU
//! model (without a GC), and it is what makes blocking `sleep()` safe. The
//! cost is one OS thread (plus a current-thread runtime) per VU, so very high
//! VU counts (e.g. 10k) are thread-heavy. That is the accepted tradeoff of
//! the 1-VU-per-task design; a future refinement could cap growth when a
//! script never calls `sleep()`.
//!
//! **Hard ceiling:** the pool never grows past `MAX_WORKERS` (4096). For a
//! bounded executor with `vus > 4096` (an extreme 10k-VU constant test), VU
//! `n` and VU `n+4096` would silently share a worker, so a blocking
//! `sleep()` in one could freeze the other — the cap trades strict isolation
//! away at extreme VU counts to avoid exhausting the OS with one thread per
//! VU. Realistic tests stay far below the cap, where isolation is exact.
//! - **Future safety** — each JsContext is only used by its pinned thread, so we
//!   could drop the `rquickjs` `parallel` feature (and its per-`ctx.with` mutex)
//!   if `JsContext` were made `!Send`
